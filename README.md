"Since the 19th century, home knitting machines were a popular manufacturing tool which allowed knitters to produce rapidly knitted items to sell or for household crafts.  The possibility to use jacquard patterns started with the use of punched hole cards and began to be computerised in the 80's. The immediate and low raw material resource needed to produce a knitted surface is what make knitting machines mobile and accessible for experimenting and prototyping. Since the late 80's these knitting machines have stopped been produced.
These last years hackers and makers have started to open up knitting machines and found new ways to hack them by allowing the machines to be controlled directly by a modern computer. These hacked knitting machines become a sort of textile printer. Having a direct communication between digital tools and the knitting machine pushes the boundaries of traditional knitted patterns and gives us the opportunity to think of new way's in conceiving patterns . 

In this workshop we will explore how our knitting machine can become a way of printing out (generated) data on a textile surface.
First we will show how the monitoring system and the arduino controls the knitting machine as well as how the mechanics of the machine works in general.
We will then experiment hands on with field recordings of our surrounding environment. Our sound cartographyâ€™s will then be translated and visualised with Pure Data and then sent to the machine to be knitted out. These patterns can be read as a visual translation of rhythms, silences and noises embedded in a palpable knitted surface." Claire Williams.
        

BROTHER KH-940

For technicals specifications see the service manual : http://maurin.box.free.fr/_DOCs/brother_kh930_knitting_machine_service_manual.pdf
- 200 steacheses
- Two end lines sensors
- One encoder wille with two sensors mounted on it :
  - The first sensor is composed by two photointerrupter embedded into a single component (SHARP IA06). This double sensor is used to sens the direction ot the carriage
  - The second sensor is a single photo interrupter used for the phase (SHARP - GP1A52LRJ00F)

This firmware is a fork of Sokanno KnitHack project : https://github.com/sokanno/KnitHack

Pure Data (patch/program)

This first program is developed for the Pure Data software, a multi-platform programming environment and open source dedicated to real-time interaction. We chose this software because it offers a type of easily accessible visual programming. In addition, supported by a global community of users it has many extensions dedicated to sound and video.

To use the Pure Data patch you must install the Pure Data Softwear : http://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended
Then you can open the patch : /PureData/KH940_soundKniting.pd
This patch will analyse a sound file with an FFT algorithm to identify all of it's frequencies.
If the volume of a specific frequency is above a certain threshold the corresponding stitch is triggered.

Sound track format
- track : mono
- format : .WAV
- freq : 44100 Hz
- resolution : 16 bits

 - A : load a sound
 - B : play this sound from the beginning to the end
 - C : start knitting

To start knitting, the carriage must be out of the sticheses on the left side.
Each time you make a row you must go from one side to the other.
At the end of the row you will hear two bip, one wen you pass the end stop sensor end one juste after that tell you when all stitch's positions are set.
